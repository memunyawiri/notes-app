### Notes app

Build a notes app as a frontend, single page web app.  You'll be guided through this by the high-level challenges listed below.  However, there will be no walkthroughs.

To get an idea of what you'll be building, here are some [user stories and a mockup](notes_app_user_stories.md) for the notes app.  (This is just to give you an idea of the app.  You'll work through the challenges below to build it.)

#### Challenges

"Spike" means writing code without writing tests.  "TDD" means develop test first.

1. [TDD a model for a note](01_note_model.md)
2. [TDD a model for a list of notes](02_note_list_model.md)
3. [TDD a note list view](03_note_list_view.md)
4. [Spike to create and serve an `index.html` page for your app](04_index_page.md)
5. [Spike code that inserts some HTML into the `index.html` page](05_insert_html_into_page.md)
6. [Spike and then TDD code that shows a note in the `index.html` page](06_display_note_list.md)
7. [TDD a single note view](07_single_note_view.md)
8. [Use TDD to show only the first 20 characters of each note on the main note list page](08_show_abbreviated_notes_in_note_list_view.md)
9. [Use TDD to finish the implementation of a single note page](09_finish_single_note_page.md)
10. [Spike adding a form to `index.html` for creating a note](10_create_note_form.md)
11. [Spike to intercept a form `submit` event emitted by the create note form](11_intercept_submit_event.md)
12. [Spike to extract note text from a form `submit` event](12_extract_note_text_from_submit_event.md)
13. [Use TDD to finish support for user note creation](13_user_create_note.md)
14. [Refactor](14_refactor.md)
15. [Extract a standalone test library](15_extract_test_library.md)
